# Activity 2

## Purpose
The purpose of this activity is to increase your experience with working with elements of the UI and databases. 

## Description

There are two challenges within the book that you should complete for this activity:

* Add a new action item to the toolbar for CrimeFragment that allows the user to select to delete the crime. Once the user presses the new delete action item, the user should be sent back to the previous activity with a call to the finish() method on the CrimeFragment's hosting activity.
* The second challenge builds off the first. When the user clicks on the delete action item, delete the crime from the database by calling a deleteCrime(Crime) method on CrimeLab, which will call mDatabase.delete(...) to finish the job. 

These challenges will require you to explore a little bit outside of the material presented in the videos to look at the documentation for the development platform (this is an important skill to get familiar with). 

## Submitting work
Once your program is working as expected, in Android Studio you need to create a commit and push the assignment as shown in the video.

I will pull all of the repositories from Github sometime after the deadline. This is the same for projects. 
Commit and push to origin early and often each time you get a block of code working as desired.
When I pull down the code after the deadline, it will pull down the most recent version of the code not your partially completed version(s).
This is also useful if you are stuck and need my help, you can push your code to Github and I can pull it onto my machine to take a look at it.
